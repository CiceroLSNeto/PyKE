***A suite of Python/PyRAF tools to analyze Kepler data.***

## Installation

The easiest way to install PyKE is through ``pip``:

    pip install pyketools

Or if you would like to experiment our development version:

    git clone https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE.git
    cd PyKE
    pip install -e .

Documentation is hosted at [readthedocs](http://pyke.rtfd.io).
Alternatively, it can be built locally:

    $ pip install sphinx numpydoc sphinx_rtd_theme
    $ cd pyke
    $ python setup.py build_sphinx

## Installation with PyRAF

To install PyKE within PyRAF, one may follow the instructions in the astroconda-iraf channel:
http://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#legacy-software-stack-with-iraf

After that, run the following commands on your favorite terminal:

1. ``mkiraf``
2. ``pyraf``
3. ``kepler``

The developer version of PyKE that is compatible with PyRAF is under the branch ``py27-pyraf``.
