Contributing
------------

PyKE is actively developed on its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE>`_.

If you encounter a problem with PyKE, we encourage you to open an issue on the GitHub repository
or to e-mail the Kepler/K2 office at keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov.
We also welcome suggestions for enhancements or new features in this way.

If you would like to contribute a patch for a bugfix, please go ahead and open a pull request.

If you want to make a more significant change, such as adding a new tool or feature,
we recommend discussing the change in advance by opening a GitHub issue.

If in doubt on how to open a pull request, we recommend Astropy's tutorial called
"`How to make a code contribution by Astropy <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html>`_".
